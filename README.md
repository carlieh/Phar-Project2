LAMP2 Project 2 - Phar Compiler
===============================

Fanshawe College LAMP2 Project 2. The purpose of this project is to build a class library that is fully re-usable and enables
developers to use and make their lives just a little bit easier. 

This project is a phar compiler that compiles phar files from a command line interface.  Phar archives are a convenient way
of grouping several files into a single file. Therefore, making it easy to distribute complete PHP applications into a single
file and running it from that file.
